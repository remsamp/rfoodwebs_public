# rfoodwebs
This is a private, cooperative repository in which a new R package will be developed. 
The package will be designed around Lydia's predator-prey data to start with. 

The aim of the package is the automated production of food webs from predator-prey data bases. 
We hope this can be useful across a range of NERC projects (like MERP, CBESS and SSP).
