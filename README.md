# rfoodwebs
This is a private, cooperative repository in which a new R package will be developed. 
The package will be designed around a privately owned data set and a number of functions
allowing its easy use. 

I will now create the skeleton of an R package on the master branch using devtools(),
then create a new branch to edit. Once I am ok with the changes I can create a pull request
between the head branch and the base one.
